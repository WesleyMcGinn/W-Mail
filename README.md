# **Deprecation Notice**:
#### For something a lot better and slightly more complicated, see my repository [https://github.com/WesleyMcGinn/Chat](https://github.com/WesleyMcGinn/Chat).

#### Chat has replaced W-Mail.  If you like W-Mail, download it or fork it so that you can use it on your own.  W-Mail will be removed on December 1st, 2022.

## Summary:
This is an extremely basic computerized mailing system.  -  No email addresses, no organizing emails, no saving emails, no passwords, and no private messages.  One can simply receive the latest message posted on the website and send a message if they want to.  A mailing system could not be more basic.
